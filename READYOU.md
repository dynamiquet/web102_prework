# WEB102 Prework - *DeepPledge*

Submitted by: **Dynamique Twizere**

**DeepPledge** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* The Stats section dynamically displays the total number of contributions, total funds raised, and the top two funded games, based on the data in the games.js file..
* The Our Games section loads and displays all the games available in the games.js file, showing images, names, backer count, and pledged amounts.
* Three buttons (Show Unfunded Only, Show Funded Only, Show All Games) allow users to filter games by their funding status, using the filter function to update the game list dynamically.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* A navbar at the top allows users to quickly navigate to the "Our Games" and "Stats" sections.
* Hover effects on buttons and game cards, as well as a modern and clean design, were added to improve the user experience.

## Notes

I found out about this opportunity pretty late, which left me with a tight timeline to work on the pre-work. That meant I also didn't have a lot of time to familiarize myself with content I have never seen before like the functions `reduce` and `filter`. I had to dive into the documentation to understand how they work, which was not ideal for me because I usually prefer reading then doing a lot of exercises to familiarize myself with the content. This time there was no familiarization; it was "learn and use"!

Also, Iâ€™ve been focusing on Python lately, which made it quite difficult to suddenly have work in Java-like syntax (JavaScript). I would find myself using Python syntax for functions and other elements. Thankfully, that got better and better as I approached the end.
